C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

* is a better C  
* supports data abstraction (e.g., classes)
* supports object-oriented programming (e.g., inheritance)
* supports generic programming (e.g., reusable generic containers and algorithms)
* supports functional programming (e.g., template metaprogramming, lambda functions, constexpr)  

It is defined by an ISO standard, offers stability over decades, and has a large and lively user community.

### Is it important to know the technical definition of “good OO”? Of “good class design”?

### What should I tell people who complain that the word “FAQ” is misleading, that it emphasizes the questions rather than the answers, and that we should all start using a different acronym?
