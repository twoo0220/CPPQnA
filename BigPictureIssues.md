> ### <a name="Rbpi-1"></a>C++은 무엇입니까?

 C++은 시스템 프로그래밍 쪽으로 살짝 특화되어 있는 범용 프로그래밍 언어로,
C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that

* C언어보다 낫고
* 데이터 추상화를 지원하고(예: class)
* 객체 지향 프로그래밍을 지원하고(예: 상속)
* 일반화(generic) 프로그래밍을 지원하고(예: 재사용 가능한 일반 컨테이너(generic container)와 알고리듬)
* 함수형 프로그래밍을 지원합니다.(예: 템플릿 메타프로그래밍, 람다 함수, constexpr)

C++는 ISO 표준으로 정의되어 있고, 수십 년에 걸쳐 안정성을 제공하며, 크고 활발한 사용자 커뮤니티를 보유하고 있습니다. 더 자세한 내용은 책 [The C++ Programming Language](https://stroustrup.com/4th.html)와 논문 [Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991-2006](https://stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf)을 참고하세요.  
C++가 [언제(when)](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/big-picture#when-invented), [왜(why)](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/big-picture#why-invented) 발명되었는지도 함께 확인해보세요.

> ### <a name="Rbpi-2"></a>Is C++ a practical language?

네.  
C++은 실용적인 도구입니다. 완벽하지는 않지만 유용합니다.  
산업용 소프트웨어 세계에서 c++는 견고하고 성숙한주류 도구로 간주됩니다. 폭넓은 산업 지원를 받고 있어 [전반적인 비즈니스 관점에서 볼 때](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/big-picture#biz-dominates-tech) '좋은' 선택이 됩니다.

### What are some features of C++ from a business perspective?

### Are virtual functions (dynamic binding) central to OO/C++?

### I’m from Missouri. Can you give me a simple reason why virtual functions (dynamic binding, dynamic polymorphism) and templates (static polymorphism) make a big difference?

### Is C++ backward compatible with ANSI/ISO C?

### Why is C++ (almost) compatible with C?

### When was C++ invented?

### Why was C++ invented?

### Where did the name C++ come from?

### What does the FAQ mean by “such and such is evil”?

### Will I sometimes use any so-called “evil” constructs?

### Is it important to know the technical definition of “good OO”? Of “good class design”?

### What should I tell people who complain that the word “FAQ” is misleading, that it emphasizes the questions rather than the answers, and that we should all start using a different acronym?
